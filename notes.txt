a deployed app should just be a kubernetes operator called logos_app that is declared to exist. it will point to the services jar and the wad of webshit, and whatever other metadata

the backend server will in whatever manner know about these and listen for changes to them and reload itself.

later this can be used to apportion apps to RPC servers; for now all will get all


another approach would be to have one running rpc server binary per app. perhaps that's desirable from a security perspective. then envoy service discovery could be used?
